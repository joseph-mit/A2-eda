      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        This EDA finds strong evidence of a long-run shift in Boston housing transactions toward greater speculative participation, especially after 2010. The key result is not based on a single proxy: flip incidence, investor purchase share, and entity-buyer share all rise relative to early-2000s levels and remain substantially elevated through much of the 2010s and early 2020s (Q1.1). Because these measures are constructed differently yet move together, the inference is much more credible than any one series alone. At the same time, the composition view adds an important correction to an overly simplistic narrative: non-investors remain the majority of buyers throughout the period, so the change is best understood as a structural reweighting of the market, not a complete takeover (Q1.6).
      </p>

      <p>
        The time-series evidence also clarifies what can and cannot be concluded about flipping behavior. Observed flip holding periods are not concentrated only in extremely short horizons; in many years, the median sits in a roughly year-to-year-and-a-half range with substantial spread, indicating heterogeneous strategies rather than one uniform “quick flip” pattern (Q1.2). The share of fast flips (≤ 12 months) appears meaningfully present in later years, but early values are noisy and denominator-sensitive, so the data do not support a clean monotonic claim that flips are becoming systematically faster (Q1.3). Most importantly, this dataset is much stronger for measuring participation and composition than for measuring true flip profitability: linked-sale profitability metrics depend on incomplete prior-sale matching, suffer from edge cases, and omit renovation, financing, taxes, fees, and carrying costs (Q1.4–Q1.5). As a result, the report can confidently argue that speculative participation increased, but not that true flip profits rose over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spatially, speculation is clearly concentrated, but not in a single, perfectly overlapping “luxury-only” geography. Across neighborhoods and ZIPs, high prices, high investor participation, and high flip activity overlap only partially (Q2.1–Q2.4). Some expensive areas are only moderately investor-heavy, while some mid/high-price areas are equally or more investor-active at much larger transaction volumes, which makes them more consequential for citywide dynamics (Q2.1, Q2.3). The ZIP ranking analysis is especially informative because it makes uncertainty visible: many middle-ranked ZIPs overlap materially, so the evidence supports broad higher-/lower-concentration zones more confidently than precise rank-order claims in the middle (Q2.2). Taken together, these results suggest that “speculation geography” is multidimensional and cannot be reduced to a single price ranking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strongest evidence for differentiated market behavior appears at the top end of the price distribution. Using a within-year top-decile definition (which controls for inflation and market-wide appreciation), the most expensive sales are consistently and often substantially more investor-heavy than the rest of the market, and that gap grows large in later years (Q3.1–Q3.3). Entity buyers are also overrepresented at the top, though less strongly and more variably than investors overall (Q3.2). The percentage-point premium and log-odds framing together show that this is not just a minor compositional difference: the upper tier increasingly behaves like a distinct, more investor-skewed submarket. Importantly, the evidence shown here directly supports a claim about the <em>most expensive</em> segment; the “newest” segment remains a valid follow-up question that would require a separate new-construction / building-age segmentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the stock-versus-flow analysis points in the same broad direction while also revealing why a single speculation proxy would be inadequate. At the neighborhood level, corporate ownership rises and owner-occupancy generally falls across the compared periods, indicating a longer-run shift in housing stock composition (Q4.1–Q4.2). Transaction dynamics also move toward higher entity-buyer share and higher flip share in the later window for the neighborhoods shown, suggesting that corporate/entity participation and resale churn often increase together (Q4.3). But the stock–flow comparison is not one-to-one: some neighborhoods show clear divergence between accumulated ownership structure and recent transaction composition (Q4.4). That mismatch is substantively important, not a flaw, because it implies that ownership change, transaction turnover, price growth, and development cycles operate on different time scales and through neighborhood-specific pathways.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        Overall, this exploratory analysis supports a strong and defensible final-project direction: treat speculation as a set of related but distinct mechanisms (investor participation, entity buying, resale churn, top-end concentration, and ownership restructuring) rather than a single metric. The most reliable next steps are to build on the strongest signals in this EDA—investor/entity concentration, top-of-market segmentation, and stock–flow linkage—while handling profitability estimates much more conservatively with stricter paired-sale matching, hold-time thresholds, and outlier controls. In that sense, the main contribution of this report is not only its findings, but also its clarification of which claims the current data can support confidently and which require additional modeling choices before they become policy-relevant.
