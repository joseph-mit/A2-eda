      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
        The clearest finding is a post-2010 structural shift toward more speculative participation in Boston transactions: flip share, investor purchase share, and entity-buyer share all rise and remain well above early-2000s levels (Q1.1), while non-investors stay the majority but lose share over time (Q1.6). Spatially, speculation is concentrated but not reducible to “the most expensive places”: high prices, high flip activity, and high investor presence overlap only partially across neighborhoods and ZIPs (Q2.1–Q2.4), and uncertainty matters for rank-order claims (Q2.2). The strongest evidence for differentiated market behavior is at the top end: within-year top-decile sales are consistently and increasingly more investor- and entity-heavy than the rest of the market (Q3.1–Q3.3). Finally, stock and flow measures generally point in the same direction but do not map perfectly (Q4.1, Q4.3, Q4.4), which suggests that a strong final project should explicitly model timing, turnover, and neighborhood development cycles rather than rely on a single speculation proxy.

        Methodologically, this EDA also surfaces a critical scope limitation: linked-sale profitability metrics are far less robust than participation/composition metrics in this dataset (Q1.4–Q1.5). That points to a practical next step for a final project pitch: prioritize investor/entity concentration, top-of-market segmentation, and stock–flow linkage, then add flip-profit estimates only with stricter matching and trimming rules.
