        <h3>Q4 — Do ownership shifts line up with transaction-dynamics shifts?</h3>
        <p class="question-restate">
          Are neighborhoods with the largest increases in corporate ownership and declines in owner occupancy also the neighborhoods where transaction dynamics shift most, i.e. higher flip share, higher corporate buyer share, and faster price growth?
        </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                The slopegraph shows a nearly uniform directional shift: every displayed neighborhood has higher corporate ownership in 2022 than in 2004. The value of this design is that it makes direction and magnitude legible simultaneously—some neighborhoods rise modestly, while others (especially South Boston Waterfront) increase much more sharply. This establishes a strong stock-side pattern before testing whether transaction flows move in parallel.

              </div>
              <p>
                Relative to 2004–07, every labeled neighborhood in this comparison moves into the upper-right quadrant in 2018–22: both entity-buyer share and flip share increase. That broad directional consistency is a meaningful result, because it suggests that “more corporate/entity participation” and “more resale churn” often rise together rather than as isolated phenomena. The added encodings (price growth color, volume size) also show that some of the largest shifts occur in major, high-growth markets rather than only in small neighborhoods.

              </div>
              <p>
                The relationship is positive for several neighborhoods, but clearly not one-to-one: places like Longwood and Downtown show both stock and flow increases, while South Boston Waterfront is a notable outlier with a very large stock increase but a negative flow shift in this window. That mismatch is analytically useful, not a failure—it suggests that accumulated ownership structure (“who holds”) can diverge from recent transaction composition (“who is buying now”) because of timing, turnover rates, and neighborhood-specific development cycles. For the final project, this is exactly the kind of result that justifies joining stock and flow datasets rather than treating either one as sufficient.
