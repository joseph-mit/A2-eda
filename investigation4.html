        <h3>Q4 — Do ownership shifts line up with transaction-dynamics shifts?</h3>
        <p class="question-restate">
          Are neighborhoods with the largest increases in corporate ownership and declines in owner occupancy also the neighborhoods where transaction dynamics shift most, i.e. higher flip share, higher corporate buyer share, and faster price growth?
        </p>

                The slopegraph shows a nearly uniform directional shift. Here, we are able to very clearly see that every displayed neighborhood has higher corporate ownership in 2022 than in 2004. The value of this design is that it makes both direction and magnitude simultaneously legible. We note from this data visualization that some neighborhoods rise modestly, while others, especially the South Boston Waterfront, increase much more sharply. This establishes a strong stock-side pattern before testing whether transaction flows move in parallel.

              <p>
                This slopegraph compares neighborhood owner-occupancy rates as a stock measure between 2004 and 2022, and shows a broad downward shift across much of the city. Most lines slope downward, indicating that the share of homes occupied by owners fell in many neighborhoods over time, with some of the clearest declines appearing in the labeled neighborhoods such as South Boston, South End, Brighton, West End, North End, Allston, Longwood, and Fenway. The pattern suggests that the changing housing market is not just about who is buying properties in a given year, but also about a longer-run reconfiguration of neighborhood housing stock toward relatively more non-owner-occupied units e.g. renter-occupied or investor-held homes. At the same time, we should be careful to note that this figure does not by itself show when the shifts happened or whether they were driven by investor purchases, new construction, demographic turnover, student/rental demand, condo conversion dynamics, or other neighborhood-specific forces.

              </div>
              <p>
                Relative to 2004–07, every labeled neighborhood in this comparison moves into the upper-right quadrant in 2018–22; both entity-buyer share and flip share increase. This broad directional consistency suggests that more corporate/entity participation, and more resale churn, often rise together rather than as isolated phenomena. In addition, the added encodings, namely price growth color and volume size, also show that some of the largest shifts occur in major, high-growth markets rather than only in small neighborhoods.

              </div>
              <p>
                The relationship is positive for several neighborhoods, but clearly not one-to-one. We see that places like Longwood and Downtown show both stock and flow increases, while the South Boston Waterfront is a notable outlier with a very large stock increase but a negative flow shift in this window. This mismatch suggests that accumulated ownership structure (“who holds”) can diverge from recent transaction composition (“who is buying now”) because of timing, turnover rates, and neighborhood-specific development cycles.
