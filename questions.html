      <h2>4 Questions</h2>

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3>
          <span class="qtag">Q1</span>
          Has speculative activity increased over time, and do flips look faster or more profitable in recent years?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> The MAPC framing as summarized in the assignment prompt treats speculation as a mechanism that can accelerate price escalation and displacement. I want to quantify whether that mechanism is visible here i.e. not just “are there flips,” but whether the market shows signs of faster turnover and increasing investor presence over time. I was motivated both by the MAPC “Homes for Profit” report as well as my own general knowledge and experience. In particular, I am motivated by my lived experience as a student trying to understand housing affordability in Greater Boston, where conversations about investment activity are common but often remain anecdotal. This question lets me test that narrative with longitudinal evidence rather than impressions alone.

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3>
          <span class="qtag">Q2</span>
          Where is speculation concentrated within Boston, and does it co-locate with high prices?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> Speculation is not evenly distributed spatially; it tends to cluster where appreciation and liquidity are strongest, and where new luxury supply is concentrated. If this dataset is capturing downtown condo markets, then I think neighborhood-level contrasts can then become a direct lens into “who is being affected where.” I was motivated both by the Boston Globe “Towers of Wealth” reading as well as my own general knowledge and experience. For me personally, I would say that this question is grounded in lived experience moving through Boston and Cambridge as a MIT graduate student and seeing how housing markets feel very different across neigborhoods even within short distances. I want to test whether those place-based patterns I noticed show up clearly in the transaction data.

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3>
          <span class="qtag">Q3</span>
          Are the newest and most expensive transactions disproportionately associated with investors or corporate buyers?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> The “towers of wealth” story is fundamentally about the top of the market behaving differently: luxury supply serving wealth storage instead of actual housing need. A strong test is a within-year price-tier comparison i.e. if the top decile is structurally more investor-heavy than the rest, that can be interpreted as a concrete signature of financialization at the high end. I was motivated both by the Boston Globe “Towers of Wealth” and ProPublica “Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord” readings as well as my own general knowledge and experience. I will say that I want this question because it separates a broad prices-are-rising story from a more specific market structure stury about who is buying te highest-end units and for which purposes.

      <div class="question-card">
        <h3>
          <span class="qtag">Q4</span>
          Are neighborhoods with the largest increases in corporate ownership and declines in owner occupancy also the neighborhoods where transaction dynamics shift most, i.e. higher flip share, higher corporate buyer share, and faster price growth?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Motivation:</strong> I want to delve deeper into the topics and quesetions above. I was motivated both by the Boston Globe “Towers of Wealth” and ProPublica “Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord” readings as well as my own general knowledge and experience. This question synthesizes the earlier questions by linking stock changes with flow changes. I am motivated by the possibility that these are related but not identical processes and I want to test whether neighborhoods that look most transformed in ownership structure are also the places where transaction behavior changes the most. For me, in Greater Boston, it is easy to observe visible neighborhood changes, but much harder to tell whether that change reflects turnover, ownership concentration, or both.
