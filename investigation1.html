                The strongest result in the report is the regime shift after 2010: flip share rises from near-zero in the early 2000s to sustained mid-single digits, while investor purchase share moves from roughly the high-teens/low-20s into the ~30% range and entity-buyer share climbs from low single digits into persistent double digits. Because these three series move together, the pattern is much more convincing than any one proxy alone. The late-2010s peak and early-2020s pullback suggest moderation at the margin, but not a return to the early-2000s baseline.

                This chart tracks how long properties are typically held before resale, using the median holding period (in months) and the interquartile range (IQR) to show spread. After the very early years of the dataset, the median flip horizon generally sits in the roughly 12–18 month range, with a notable spike around the late-2000s/2010 period, suggesting that resale timing became slower and more variable during that market phase. The fairly wide IQR in many years indicates that “flipping” is not one uniform strategy, i.e. some properties are resold relatively quickly, while others are held much longer, perhaps due to renovation timelines, financing constraints, or market conditions. A key data caveat is that the first year(s) may be mechanically compressed because the transaction dataset begins in 2000, which can make early holding periods look artificially short due to left-censoring / boundary effect which truncates earlier purchase histories.

              <p>
                This chart is best read as a composition metric within observed flips, not as a citywide trend in all sales. Early values (including 100% and the 2010 collapse to 0%) are almost certainly dominated by very small denominators and linkage sparsity, so they are not reliable evidence on their own. The more informative pattern is the post-2011 period, where the fast-flip share stabilizes in a broad ~35–47% band, implying that a substantial fraction of flips are still relatively rapid even after the early noisy years.

              </div>
              <p>
                This figure is useful mainly because it shows why profitability is hard to estimate cleanly in transaction-only data. The series contains clear edge-case behavior(e.g. the extreme early spike and the -100% median in 2010, and even the more stable years reflect only gross resale-price change on linked pairs, excluding renovation costs, carrying costs, financing, taxes, and fees. I can thus say that speculative activity rises, but I cannot claim a robust time trend in true flip profitability from this metric alone.

              </div>
              <p>
                This is an intentionally retained “failed” view. Here, we see that annualization explodes when holding periods are very short, and one extreme value expands the y-axis so much that the rest of the series becomes unreadable. As an exploratory result, that failure is informative to us still because it shows that annualized ROI is not a safe default summary for flips without first winsorizing and a minimum holding-period rule. For a later version, I would impose a hold-time floor e.g. 90 or 180 days, and report robust quantiles instead of raw annualized medians.

              </div>
              <p>
                The composition view adds an important nuance to Q1.1: non-investors remain the majority throughout, but their share visibly narrows over time, especially through the 2010s, before a partial rebound in the early 2020s. That means the story is not “investors replaced everyone,” but rather “investors became a much larger slice of an already large market.” A limitation of the stacked area format is that small subtype bands are hard to compare precisely, so this figure is best for the macro shift in mix rather than fine-grained subtype ranking.
