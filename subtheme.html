      <p class="lead">Exploring speculation and housing for the rich.</p>
      <p>
        Drawing from analyzing more than 20 years of real estate transactions with census data, projects could explore speculative investment, practices of buying up and “flipping” homes, and the connections to housing affordability. Which communities are most affected across the area? Projects could also explore the impacts of absentee owners, i.e. people who buy a high-end property solely as an investment vehicle and don’t live there. This can have the effect of driving up prices while taking housing supply off the market. What are the effects of this on affordable housing for non-wealthy people in Boston?
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, MAPC released the “Homes for Profit” report about the negative effects of speculation in the Metro Boston housing market, including driving up prices and displacing residents. Undertaking an analysis of more than twenty years of real estate transactions, students can build on MAPC’s work to dive deeper into these questions to analyze how much profit investors are making from “flips”, examine large corporations buying up housing stock, and/or visualize who (and where) is being most affected by speculative investment. Additionally, they can investigate absentee owners, i.e. people who buy a high-end property solely as an investment vehicle and don’t live there. This can have the effect of driving up prices while taking housing supply off the market. One area worthy of investigation is the increase in housing production for extremely wealthy, absentee owners. What proportion of Boston’s newest and most expensive high-rises are owned by corporations? By absentee owners? What are the connections between high income and absentee-ism? What proportion of the city is owned by people who don’t live here? Just how unaffordable are these developments for average Bostonians?
