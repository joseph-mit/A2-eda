              </div>
              <p>
                The top decile, within each year, is dramatically more investor-heavy than the bottom 90% in every year shown, and often by very large margins. Defining the top segment within-year is a crucial normalization step here. It controls for inflation and broad market appreciation, so the comparison captures market structure rather than nominal price drift. This figure provides strong support for the “towers of wealth” hypothesis that the top end functions differently from the broader housing market.

              </div>
              <p>
                We expressing the difference in percentage points to illustrate magnitude. The investor-share premium is positive in every year and grows to very large values, while the entity-buyer premium is also consistently positive but smaller and noisier. This gap suggests that top-end financialization is driven not only by corporate/entity buyers, but also by individual investors. By plotting both premiums together, the chart separates a broad investor-skew story from a narrower corporate-vehicle story.

              </div>
              <p>
                The log-odds framing complements the percentage-point gap by measuring relative skew, and it shows a clear upward trend over time. In practical terms, later years are not just a few points more investor-heavy at the top. In fact, the odds of an investor buyer in the top decile become dramatically larger relative to the rest of the market. Combined with the other two data visualizations on this page, this makes Q3 the strongest evidence in the report that high-end housing is increasingly behaving like a distinct, more financialized submarket.
